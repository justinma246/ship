# GENERAL
Ship is a dating app where you can "ship" 2 other people based on their presented profile. Connected to social media (Facebook), you  matchmake others based on their pictures, basic information, interests, and more!  

The shipper will be given the option to either ship or sink the pairing. To join the pool of bachelors and bachelorettes, you must remain active!

After enough ships from users (deemed on a personal ship threshold made to reduce spam shipping and raise standards), the couple will then be matched up and are able to chat using our own messaging system.

Potential matches are based on location, gender, profile similarity ratings, and more! 

In addition to all of this, achievements can be unlocked based on things such as the number of successful ships they voted on and the number of successful ships they were a part of.

Get shipping!
